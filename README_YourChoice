I have done some code cleanup, getting rid of some redundancies in my xml files.  I have added some comments to help now that the code
is getting longer.  Got rid of buttons and replaced them with plain text.  Added a quick rundown of how to play the game in the help
section.  Added a sensor to the background of the start screen,that changes background based on light, kept luminosity scale for future
testing.  Added a placeholder image to the start screen.  

I have one match game done, its rough around the edges, but does work.  I used a gridview and drawables, it was easy to follow along
with but is hard to customize.  I thnk I will keep it in as a very easy mode for the game.  The tiles do work for a match, but you can
click multiple times on the card, and it reverts to the back of the card, and messes with the counter for game over.  The cards do not
flip over on the second click, but do let you know that it is not a match.  The images are place holders for now, I tried using 128x128
images and was having problems fitting them, so I tried 56x56, it looks better, but not perfect.

I have been programming the match games outside my semester project to make sure I get it right before putting it in my project.

I am going to try some different types of match game methods, for additional games.  I think I am going to try to use buttons for
the images, I think this will make, making more games easier.  I am also more familiar with onClickListeners, and using buttons.
