My application is saving user profile names, and preferences for sound and music, being on or off.  The save button is used to save
the user name, and the toggle buttons for the preferences saves without having to use the save button.

I am using key values to save user name and preferences.

My application saves are all currently on the settings page, but I will be using it for saving high scores, using a sql database.
